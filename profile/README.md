# Welcome to PACS!

PACS (Practical Applications of Computer Science) is a university club at Toronto Metropolitan (formerly Ryerson) University dedicated to helping students bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in computer science. Our primary focus is on helping students build more concrete coding portfolios, thereby enhancing the skills and employability of our members.

## Mission

Our mission at PACS is to empower students with practical coding experience, enabling them to apply the theoretical concepts learned in classrooms to real-world projects. We believe that academic curricula often prioritize theoretical knowledge, leaving limited time for hands-on application. Our work is rooted in filling this gap by providing opportunities for members to develop tangible skills through workshops, events, and tutorial sessions.

## Goals

Build Practical Skills: We aim to equip students with the skills necessary to excel in the real-world application of computer science. By focusing on practical projects, we help members build a robust coding portfolio.

Bridging the Gap: PACS serves as a bridge between theoretical knowledge and vocational experience. We believe that a well-rounded education includes both understanding the principles and applying them in real-world scenarios.

Foster Collaboration: We encourage collaboration among members, fostering an environment where students can learn from each other, share ideas, and work together on projects. Collaboration enhances creativity and problem-solving skills.

## Objectives

### 1. Workshops and Events

PACS organizes workshops and events that cover various practical applications of programming. These sessions focus on real-world projects, such as website development and application development, providing members with the opportunity to apply coding skills in a guided and supportive environment.

### 2. Drop-in Sessions

We host drop-in sessions tailored to personal projects. If youâ€™ve got a person project requiring the assistance of your peers, our experienced members are available to provide guidance, answer questions, and offer valuable insights to help you overcome any challenge.

### 3. Portfolio Development

PACS is dedicated to helping members build a strong coding portfolio. Through our activities, members can showcase their practical skills, making them more competitive in the job market and better prepared for future endeavors.

### 4. Networking Opportunities

PACS fosters valuable networking connections by creating opportunities for members to connect with industry professionals, other students, and experts. Guest speakers, alumni events, and industry partnerships are just some of the ways we facilitate these interactions.
